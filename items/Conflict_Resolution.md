# Conflict Resolution Protocol

This protocol outlines how our team will handle conflicts and unforeseen issues during the COMP2100 project.

## Principles
- Communicate openly via group Discord server and Email
- Raise issues early, document them in meeting minutes
- Escalate to course conveners if unresolved

## Scenarios

### 1. Member is sick in the final week
- Notify the team ASAP on Discord or via email
- Redistribute tasks based on workload
- Escalate to course conveners if needed

### 2. Task incomplete before checkpoint
- Discuss 2 days before the checkpoint
- Redistribute if necessary
- Document in meeting minutes

### 3. Member unreachable (no response in 2 days)
- Attempt any alternative contact
- If no response in 3 days, redistribute tasks and log the issue
- Escalate to course conveners if needed

### 4. Disagreement on assignment requirements
- Hold a meeting to discuss interpretations
- If still unresolved, seek clarification via Ed or course conveners

## Escalation
- If consensus cannot be reached, escalate to the course conveners
