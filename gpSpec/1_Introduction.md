Each group should consist of 5 students. Groups can contain a mix of undergraduate and master students and students from different labs.

**Your group must be created and registered on Wattle, or alternatively, you can register for `RandPool` on Wattle and you will be randomly assigned to a group by us. Note that RandPool students will be locked into the assigned group.**

Develop an app that helps businesses and individuals reduce regulatory burden by 	streamlining compliance processes and providing real-time regulatory guidance. This app 	can integrate various compliance requirements, automate reporting, and offer alerts for 	deadlines and policy changes, making it easier to navigate complex regulations. Examples: 	Regulatory Compliance Tracker, Tax Filing Assistant, Business License Manager, Policy 	Update Notifier.

Register your group and checkpoint on Wattle by Monday of Week 7.
More information will be released on the EdStem Forum about the registrations.

**Do not start late, it may impact your project outcomes.**

Android Studio:
- The whole team should use the same version of Android Studio to avoid configuration conflicts.
- Please use API level 34 or 35 for your target and compile SDK. For Min. SDK, you may select the default or an API level between 29 and 31. If you use another API level, you must explicitly mention it in your report to avoid losing marks.

If you wish to deviate from any requirements in this specification, you must contact the conveners and obtain **written approval (and include in your report)** as soon as possible (Ed posts are acceptable). Appeals based on disagreement with a specific requirement will not be accepted – clarify any requirement if you need.



## Introduction

In this group assignment, you must design and implement a mobile application using several important development tools — particularly Android Studio and Git — with Java. More importantly, it provides an opportunity to reason about and apply fundamental software construction concepts in practice.

As you complete this project, you should reflect on the overall design and the software engineering process you used in completing it.  Note that this is not only about writing the best app, but also who could best manifest what they have learned in this course. 
**The journey (as revealed in regular meetings, regular contributions/commits, etc.) is just as important as the final app.**

We do not expect a fully operational app—simplifications are acceptable as long as the core requirements and concepts taught in the course are well-implemented. The key assessment aspects include *Data Structures, Tokeniser/Parser, Data Persistence, Design Patterns, Software Testing, and Code Quality*.
